A project extension for the [Muse Test Framework](https://github.com/ChrisLMerrill/muse) 
and [MuseIDE](http://ide4selenium.com). The extension currently contains just one plugin. 

# Send Measurements to Graphite plugin

The plugin is a Measurements Consumer. When it receives measurements, it sends them to a Graphite/Carbon server.

## Installation

The extension is distributed with the rest of the MuseIDE extension - press the Extensions button in MuseIDE to add it to your project.  

## Configuration

The configuration of the plugin is described on [this blog post](https://www.webperformance.com/load-testing-tools/blog/2018/05/announcing-the-graphite-extension-for-museide/).


# Thanks and Credits

I originally developed this as part of my load testing work for [Web Performance](http://webperformance.com/). Thanks 
goes there for allowing me to open-source the work. I have several posts on the 
[Web Performance Blog](https://www.webperformance.com/load-testing-tools/blog/) related to 
[MuseIDE](https://www.webperformance.com/load-testing-tools/blog/category/museide/) and 
[load testing](https://www.webperformance.com/load-testing-tools/blog/category/load-testing/).
